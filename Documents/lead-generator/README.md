# LeadGenerator

This project was generated by Vibhor Papneja.

Currently, we are keeping the two users static object in our service and also keeping the leads dummy data, due to this on reloading the data will be refreshed to static data and the changes will be lost

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
